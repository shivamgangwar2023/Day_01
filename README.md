# Image-Compressor-ML-Project
In this Project, I have implemented an image compressor , using machine learning algorithms like K-means, and libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib,etc.
* K-Means is a commertially important unsupervised Learning Algorithm used for grouping/clustering similar data points together. 
* It is used in various Anomaly Detection,Market Analysis, customer segmentation.
* A 24-bit color representation of an image has three 8-bit unsigned integer values of each pixel, that specify the red, blue and green values.
* An image has thousand of colors, we will reduce it to only 16 using K-Means Algorithm.
